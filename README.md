# Timecards

This is a small Windows app for tracking your time.

This application is intended to serve not only as a useful utility, but it also as an example of a properly designed multi-layer application in that it has an inner core and outside layers for data access and the user interface.

This is currently a work in progress.  At this time, the core and data layers are finished, and the UI is nearly done.  The remaining task is to wire up the controls so they have access to the data.

See the "Design Notes" document for notes on the overall design and a running commentary on what was discovered during development.
