# Timecards

## Description

This is a Windows application for recording how much time you spend on various
projects.  At any time, you can report the total amount of time you've spent
on each project.

### Development Features of Interest

This application is an example of "clean architecture" in that it separates core
application functionality from persistence and user interface.

This application uses SQLite - a lightweight, zero-footprint relational database
engine.  It uses Microsoft's Entity Framework and Code First to maintain the
database schema and provide quick, efficient access to the data.

See the "README" files for each component for an explanation of the features in
this application.

## Installation

I'm working on that.  Stay tuned.
